# Fake-News-Classifier
This repository consists of 2 models

1. Fake_News_Classifier_Final --> The model uses LSTM RNN to predict whether the news is fake or real

2. Fake_News_Classifier_Comparison --> This notebook compares the performance of LSTM RNN and Bidirectional LSTM RNN on the same dataset to predict whether the news is fake or real

The Bidirectional LSTM RNN performs better on this particular dataset
